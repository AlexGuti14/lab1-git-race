# How to build the code

This application uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org) to build the code. Please, refer to the [Gradle user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) for its installation. Once it is installed just do:

```
$ cd lab1-git-race
$ gradle build
```

After a few seconds, "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" indicates that the build has completed. There youâ€™ll find generated WAR file inside *libs* folder under *build* directory.
